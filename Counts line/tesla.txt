Who Was Nikola Tesla?
Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the alternating-current (AC) 
electric system, which is the predominant electrical system used across the world today. 
He also created the "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. 
Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with 
Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to 
his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.
